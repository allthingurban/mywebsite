How many households in India do not have access to any kind of latrine? Well, the answer varies, depending on which data set you are looking at.Although all datasets agree that there is significant progress in household's access to toilets, especially in rural areas, there is no agreement on extent of progress. 

After 2011, there has been no census so we do not really know the exact situation. There are other household surveys to estimate the progress in access to toilet. Data from NSS and NFHS, the two most robust and comprehensive household surveys, suggest that there is considerable progress in access to toilet, however the data on usage is sporadically collected and hence progress on usage is still not adequately known. 

All the surveys that capture information on access to toilet can be divided in two categories - surveys that capture information on sanitation along with other Household information, like NSS and NFHS and surveys that are designed for collecting information on access to toilet, like NARS. Later are less reliable because its main objective is to ascertain the progress on SBM rather than estimating the access to toilet for everyone. 

This webpage provides analysis of data on sanitation from different data  sources.
